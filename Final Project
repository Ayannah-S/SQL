SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

--2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

--4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeID
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

--7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.Total
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust

JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId;

--8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';

--OR

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)

--11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tracks.Name as Track, art.Name as Artist, inv.InvoiceLineId

LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks tracks

JOIN chinook.albums albums
ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists art
ON art.ArtistID = albums.ArtistId;

--12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT tracks.Name as 'Tracks', med.Name as 'Media Type', albums.Title as 'Album Title', genres.Name as 'Genre'

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

--14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' AND inv.InvoiceDate like '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) DESC
LIMIT 1;
